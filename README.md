CSPT - Cross-Stitch pattern tool
Converts a given ppm image into a cross-stitch pattern. Currently can only output the pattern in terms of pattern symbols without a legend to map symbols to DMC threads.
To build, run make on the makefile and to run, run CSPT.exe.
WARNING: Since switching test environments this project is broken and will be fixed soon.
